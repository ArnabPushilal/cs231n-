These are some notes and information which are I am learning during the course

http://cs231n.stanford.edu/vecDerivs.pdf -> good insights on simplying gradient & chain rule calculations
https://madalinabuzau.github.io/2016/11/29/gradient-descent-on-a-softmax-cross-entropy-cost-function.html -> Gradient on SoftMax classifier [ helped me figured out the derivation for the gradient of the SVM classifier ]
